    <h2 id="team-dynamics-and-collaboration">Team Dynamics and Collaboration</h2>
    
    <p>As outlined in section ###, our team consists of four members, each from a different country and with diverse professional backgrounds. To overcome potential challenges, prevent conflicts, improve communication, and establish a positive working environment, the team decided to invest in team-building activities before starting the project work.</p>
    
    <p>In our collaboration, team members engage in both group and individual tasks. Group activities and workshops will take place in person, aiming to enhance creativity through direct interaction. On the other hand, individual tasks primarily involve preparation and documentation. Each team member has the freedom to choose their preferred methods for these tasks, as long as they meet the specified deadlines.</p>
    
    <p>For asynchronous communication, the team will utilize WhatsApp.</p>
    
    <p>Additionally, the group has collectively established five fundamental principles to foster successful collaboration:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>reliability</li>
    <li></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="tools-and-information-management">Tools and Information Management</h2>
    
    <p>The group decided to utilize the following tools for efficient project-related information management and communication.</p>
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="text-align:left;"/>
    <col style="text-align:left;"/>
    </colgroup>
    
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th style="text-align:left;">Tool</th>
        <th style="text-align:left;">Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align:left;">Notion</td>
        <td style="text-align:left;">Designated as the central hub, Notion serves as a singular source of truth. It houses a kanban board to visualize, coordinate, and document tasks and milestones. Additionally, it aids in organizing resources like papers, interviews, etc., by linking them.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align:left;">OneDrive</td>
        <td style="text-align:left;">Using the university's secure infrastructure, all resources will be stored on AAU's OneDrive, in regards to GDPR regulations. Access to reading or writing will be restricted to group members for confidentiality. Links to specific files/folders will be organized within Notion for ease of navigation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align:left;">Figma</td>
        <td style="text-align:left;">Employed for graphical work, a collaborative Figma file is set up exclusively accessible to group members. Figma may also be utilized for workshop facilitation, although the team has a preference for analog methods.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align:left;">WhatsApp</td>
        <td style="text-align:left;">Selected for short, asynchronous coordinative communication, a dedicated group chat will be utilized.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <p>While this document was created collaboratively using a shared Word file, the team has yet to reach a consensus on the tool for composing the project report. Considering the necessity for extensive citations and adherence to scientific standards, employing LaTeX could offer notable advantages. However, it's important to note that LaTeX may present a learning curve for a majority of the team. Consequently, the group is planning a brief presentation to provide an understanding of the efforts involved in using LaTeX.</p>
    
    <h2 id="milestones-and-timeline">Milestones and Timeline</h2>
    
    <p>not yet finished</p>
    
    <p>Milestone Deadline Description
    Project Plan [Insert Deadline] Develop a comprehensive 15-page document outlining how the group will organize and execute the project.
    Slides [Insert Deadline] Create 8 visually engaging slides to present the project results effectively.
    Project Report [Insert Deadline] Produce a 60-page scientific document detailing the project's process, providing scientific reasoning and explanations.</p>
    
    <p>Additionally, the group has scheduled four workshops to initiate the project, aligning with the four phases of the double diamond (refer to section ### for details). To optimize efficiency, distribute the workload, and ensure diverse moderation, each workshop will be led and documented by a different group member. By the end of this phase, every group member will have conducted one workshop. The workshops will be conducted in person</p>
    
    <h1 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h1>
    
    <p>XXXXX has tasked the students to ...</p>
    
    <p>Design a service that will leverage the 20% model for the benefit of both employees and the company.</p>
    
    <p>To ensure a shared and precise understanding, the group collectively defined key elements of the brief:</p>
    
    <p>Design a <strong>service</strong>
    &quot;A Service is an activity or benefit that one party can give to another that is essentially Intangible and does not result in the ownership of anything. Its production may or may not be tied to a physical product&quot; (Philip Kotler) </p>
    
    <p>that <strong>will leverage</strong>
    will = not visible right away, leverage? how to measure? </p>
    
    <p>expectation management</p>
    
    <p>the <strong>20% model</strong>
    According to the project description
    &quot;[t]he 20% project is a business model in which company employees are given 20% of their work time to work on projects they are passionate about that were not part of their job description.&quot;</p>
    
    <p>The Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin
    encouraged their employees &quot;[...] to spend 20 percent of their time working on what they think will most benefit Google&quot; (reference)</p>
    
    <p>While both definitions emphasize that employees allocate 20% of their time to projects beyond their regular responsibilities, there is a discrepancy in initiative and motivation. This difference may impact the project's outcome. Consequently, the group agreed on ... </p>
    
    <p>for the <strong>benefit of</strong> both <strong>employees</strong> and the <strong>company</strong>.
    It has been reported that in some cases the 20% model has caused an increase in the weekly working hours of employees (reference). Specifically stating that both parties shall benefit, stresses that the students shall design the service in a way that such negative effects on the employee's workload are prevented.</p>
